You want to build muscle.
You want to get strong.
And you want to do these things as quickly and effectively as possible.

Ask different people and you’ll get different answers.
Some will say that compound exercises are all you need. They train every muscle in your body and are
“highly functional” to boot. Others will say compound exercises are overrated or even dangerous, and
that the right isolation exercises can give you everything your little heart desires.
